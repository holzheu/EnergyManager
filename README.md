# EnergyManager

## Motivation

The generation of renewable energy from wind and PV fluctuates. Dynamic consumers and storage systems are therefore an important component of the energy transition.

Private households can participate in the energy transition with their own PV systems, battery storage, electric cars, heat pumps and dynamic electricity tariffs. However, the appliances available in households are often not operated in a grid-friendly manner. For example, PV batteries often charge in the morning when there is actually still a lack of electricity in the grid and are full at midday when there is more electricity available than is required.

Based on PV and temperature forecasts and day-ahead electricity prices, the EnergyManager is designed to automatically optimise operation.
